# Donkey Kong 2D - Java Game

## Description

This is a 2D game inspired by the classic **Donkey Kong**, developed in **Java**. The project was originally created as part of the **Object-Oriented Programming (POO)** course. Currently, I am working on improving and expanding the project to enhance its features and gameplay.

The game follows the original mechanics where the main character (Manel) must climb platforms to rescue the princess while avoiding obstacles like traps, enemies and bananas thrown by Donkey Kong.

**Note:** The initial structure of the game was provided by my professors as part of the course. They set up a basic package structure with the following components:

- **objects** – A package with manel, floor and a wall.
- **pt.iscte.poo.game** – The basic game logic framework.
- **pt.iscte.poo.gui** – The starting point for the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **pt.iscte.poo.observer** – A package classes for implementing the observer pattern.
- **pt.iscte.poo.utils** – Some utility classes with initial code that supported future game functionality.

These files enabled the initialization of the game but did not contain any gameplay or interactive content. I then expanded on this initial setup by modifying some of the game initialization logic, implementing the core gameplay mechanics, adding levels, and creating a scoreboard to meet the project requirements, along with some extra features, such as animations and other components, to make the game more enjoyable.

Although efficiency was not a priority at the outset due to the project's smaller scale and the primary focus on its object-oriented programming (OOP) aspects, I now plan to shift my attention toward optimizing the game, enhancing its performance, and improving its overall quality.

## Game Commands

Here are the commands you can use during gameplay:

- **Arrow Keys**: Move your character (Manel) left, right, up, and down.
- **B**: Drop a bomb at the current position

## Features

- 2D game with simple graphics.
- Main character (Manel) can move left, right, up, and down, and can temporarily become immune to gravity while moving fast between platforms.
- Avoid enemies, traps and obstacles thrown by Donkey Kong.
- Multiple levels with increasing difficulty.
- Scoring system based on time.

## Technologies Used

- **Java** (for game logic and graphical interface interaction).
- **Java Swing** (for graphical interface and window handling).

## How to Run the Game

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MD2SA/DonkeyKong.git

2. Run the Game

- Option 1: Using an IDE (e.g., Eclipse)
  - If you're using an IDE like Eclipse, simply open the project and run the `Main` class directly.
    
- Option 2: Using Command Line (Manual Compilation)
  - If you prefer running the game via the command line or have made changes to the code, you can compile and run it manually. To make this process easier for Windows users, a script `run.ps1` has been created.

    ```bash
    .\run.ps1
